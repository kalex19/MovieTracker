# Movie Tracker: Mod 3

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a movie tracker that pulls data from MovieDB API via fetch calls. The data rendered movie information on cards that could be favorited by the user. The engineers had the flexibility to choose the category and amount of data fetched along with the UI design.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

## Learning Goals

* Create a website using Redux, Router, and Thunk
* Fetch data from a large public database
* Async testing

## Successes

This project was first built in react and then converted to redux with router and thunk added in. This conversion was completed successfully. The UI was user tested and modifications were made based on user feedback. The fetch calls are successfully tested. 

## Challenges

Understanding redux and honing the skills of catching minor errors unpon first glance, took some time to do, delaying the project schedule, leading to an unfinished project (see issues for upcoming features).


## Technologies Used

* HTML 
* ES6 classes
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* Redux
* Router
* Thunk
* Manipulating APIs
* Testing with Jest & Enzyme
* Webpack
* NPM
* ESLint
